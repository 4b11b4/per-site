  <!--- Alternatively, a navigation bar would be implemented with a
    placeholder and you would use jQuery to insert it in any page you want.
    Another alternative to jQuery would be "HTML Imports", but this is
    divisively supported by browsers.
    I don't want my personal site to need Javascript, so I'll only have it
    on the home page. People can use the back button.

  <h1>3D Printed Knurled Nut "Suction Cup" Driver Bit</h1>
    <p>This page is a write up with information on how to customize, print, and
    use this 3D printed knurled nut driver bit. This bit is unlike others in
    that it <u><b>is designed to be used with a power tool</b></u>. It does 
    <u><b>not</b></u> have any risk of "over-tightening" or "over-torque-ing"
    the nuts and destroying a jack.
    It is designed to slip rather than "over-torque".</p>

    <h2>Other People's Designs</h2>
    <p>
    Traditionally, most designs rely on two little "slots" or "notches".
    The tools slide into these notches, the same way a screwdriver slides into
    a horizontal ("flathead") or cross ("Phillips") slot. Sometimes it is hard
    to line up with the "slots" on a 3.5mm knurled nut, so some tools also
    provide an alignment pin which goes into the 3.5mm jack itself.<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/4b11b4/knurled-nut-driver">You can find a list
    of alternative tools at the bottom of the README of the GitHub repository.</a>
    </p>
  <img src="cyl_cutout_30deg.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
  <h2>The Design</h2>
    Initially, I designed a bit to also fit in these "slots". However, these
    quickly wore out. Instead, this bit is designed to use the force of friction.
