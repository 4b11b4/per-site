      <b>how to:</b> print, customize and
      successfully use a 3d printed bit for tightening "knurled nuts" on 
      eurorack systems. It could be modified for other systems. If you are
      going to bother to print one out you might as well read on? Maybe
      there is something helpful down there...
    </p>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
    The bit may be an improvement over existing tools for certain applications, the main reason being it
    <b><u>is designed to be used with a power tool</u></b>. If you are producing
    Eurorack modules at any volume by hand, this will reduce the duration of 
    your life spent tightening nuts.<br>
    <br>
    It is usually a bad idea to tighten a nut with a power tool because it is
    easy to over-tighten. You can destroy the nut, damage the faceplate, or destroy the
    threads on the the 3.5mm jack.<br>
    <br>
    However, <b>when using the appropriate low power driver, the risk for damage is very low.</b>
    Risk of slipping and scratching a faceplate is minimized
    by the bit itself. It is
    made of plastic and not metal.
    Additionally, if over-tightening does occur, this bit takes damage 
    instead of your equipment.<br>
    <br>
    Because the bit does experience wear, I have attempted to design it in a way that
    extends the life as it is used. As one layer wears away, the layer above
    continues to provides friction.

    <h2>Other People's Designs</h2>
    <p>
    Most designs rely on two little "slots" or "notches" on the
    knurled nut. 
    A tool slides into these "slots", the same way a screwdriver slides into
    a horizontal ("flathead") or cross ("Phillips") slot on a screw. Sometimes it is hard
    to line up with these "slots". You can also slip out of the notches if you
    are not holding the tool perpendicular enough. To prevent this, some tools also
    provide a center alignment pin which goes into the 3.5mm jack itself.<br><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/4b11b4/knurled-nut-driver">You can find a list
    of alternative tools at the bottom of the README at the GitHub repository.</a>

  <h2>The Driver (Power Tool)</h2>
    This bit is designed to be used with a power tool. Below are actual drivers
    I have purchased and tried.
    I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/2NiDalt"><b>Ansee</b></a> driver.
    <br><br>
    <i>note: it is possible to use this by hand as well. I am reasonably fast
       with it by hand, but of course much slower than with a power tool.</i>

  <h2>More Details About The Design</h2>
    Initially, I designed a bit to also fit in these "slots". However, these
    were quickly destroyed when using a power tool... and the whole point of
    this design is to be able to use it <b>with a power tool</b>. You will find
    many people recommending not to do this in various places on the internet. 
    We have been successfully using this bit with a power tool in production. 
    <br><br> 
    Instead of utilizing the slots on a knurled nut, this bit is designed to
    use the force of friction. You can see in the image on the left that the
    bit has a "cone-shaped"
    cutout. As you push down on the knurled nut, this cone
    squeezes down. The concept is that simple.
    <br><br>
    Because the bit does not use the slots of the knurled nut, it is easier to
    align. It fits at any rotation. You don't need to be careful about slipping 
    out of the slots. If you try to over-torque the nut, the bit simply
    spins rather because it is not locked into place (via the slots).
    This drastically reduces the chance for destroying your jacks with too much
    torque. The bit takes damage rather than the nut.
    <br><br>
    The risk of damage to your Eurorack faceplate is lessened as well. Because 
    the bit is made of plastic (I am printing with PLA), you don't have as much
    risk of scratching the faceplate as you would with a metal driver.
    <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87VO5FZRd8">You can see the bit in action with a power tool here.</a><br>
    <!--<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87VO5FZRd8?controls=0"></iframe>-->
    In the video, the driver is set to a specific amount of torque. You can see and hear
    when it reaches the desired level of toruqe.<br><br>
    In this video, the nuts are torqued slightly past hand-tightened strength.

  <h2>Knurled... squared?</h2>
    After some weeks of testing... I have made some improvements to the driver
    to reduce the rate at which it wears. I knurled the <b><i>inside</i></b> of
    the bit. I added some "teeth". To do this, I 
    created a cylinder. Then, in a "for" loop subtracted a triangle at different
    rotations.
    <br><br>
    In other words, imagine you're making 
    a pizza. Then, you cut a big triangle centered at the middle.
    With your knife, you cut <b><i>almost</i></b>
    to the edges.
    Then do that again, but first, rotate your triangle 10 degrees.
    If you're rotating by 10 degrees, to go all the way around you'll need to
    make (360 degrees / 10 degrees = 36 - 1) 35(?) triangle cutouts.
    If you're looking at the pizza from outside in... you'll see a bunch of 
    a bunch of ridges poking out from the inside (the tops of all of the
    triangles).
    <br><br>
    The rate at which the driver wears is hard to quantify. It will
    be based on these variables:
    <ul>
      <li>how much torque the driver is set to</li>
      <li>how hard you are pushing down</li>
      <li>how quick you are to stop after torque is reached</li>
      <li>material used with 3D printer</li>
    </ul<>

  <h2>Customization</h2>
  You'll want to adapt this to 4 or 6mm hex bits.
