alt Attribute
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.
The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a vision impaired person, can "hear" the element.
e.g. <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="Girl with a jacket">
disabled Attribute
Specifies that an input element should be disabled
id Attribute
Specifies a unique id for an element
style Attribute
Specifies an inline CSS style for an element

  <h1>Meet the Knurled<sup>2</sup> Nut Driver</h1>
    <p>This page is a write up with information on how to customize, print, and
    use this 3D printed knurled nut driver bit. This bit is unlike others in
    that it <b><u>is designed to be used with a power tool</u></b>. 
    When using the proper driver, <b><u>it has almost no 
    risk</u></b> of "over-tightening" or "over-torque-ing" the nuts and
    destroying a jack.
    It is designed to slip rather instead of over tightening.</p>

    <h2>Other People's Designs</h2>
    <p>
    Most designs rely on two little "slots" or "notches" on the
    knurled nut. 
    A tool slides into these "slots", the same way a screwdriver slides into
    a horizontal ("flathead") or cross ("Phillips") slot on a screw. Sometimes it is hard
    to line up with these "slots". You can also slip out of the notches if you
    are not holding the tool perpendicular enough. To prevent this, some tools also
    provide a center alignment pin which goes into the 3.5mm jack itself.<br><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/4b11b4/knurled-nut-driver">You can find a list
    of alternative tools at the bottom of the README of the GitHub repository.</a>
    </p>
  <img src="img/cyl_cutout_30deg.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
  <h2>The Design</h2>
    Initially, I designed a bit to also fit in these "slots". However, these
    were quickly destroyed when using a power tool... and the whole point of
    this design is to be able to use it <b>with a power tool</b>. You will find
    many people recommending not to do this in various places on the internet. 
    We have been successfully using this bit with a power tool in production. 
    <br><br> 
    Instead, of utilizing the slots on a knurled nut, this bit is designed to
    use the force of friction. You can see in the image on the left that the
    bit has a "cone-shaped"
    cutout. As you push down on the knurled nut, this cone
    squeezes down. The concept is that simple.
    <br><br>
    Because the bit does not use the slots of the knurled nut, it is easier to
    align. It fits at any rotation. You don't need to be careful about slipping 
    out of the slots. If you try to over-torque the nut, the bit simply
    spins rather because it is not locked into place (via the slots).
    This drastically reduces the chance for destroying your jacks with too much
    torque. The bit takes damage rather than the nut.
    <br><br>
    The risk of damage to your Eurorack faceplate is lessened as well. Because 
    the bit is made of plastic (I am printing with PLA), you don't have as much
    risk of scratching the faceplate as you would with a metal driver.
    <br><br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87VO5FZRd8">You can see the bit in action with a power tool here.</a><br>
    <!--<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a87VO5FZRd8?controls=0"></iframe>-->
    In the video, the driver is set to a specific amount of torque. You can see and hear
    when it reaches the desired level of toruqe.<br><br>
    In this video, the nuts are torqued slightly past hand-tightened strength.
    <br><br>

  <h2>Knurled... squared?</h2>
    After some weeks of testing... I have made some improvements to the driver
    to reduce the rate at which it wears. I knurled the <b><i>inside</i></b> of
    the bit. I added some "teeth". To do this, I 
    created a cylinder. Then, in a "for" loop subtracted a triangle at different
    rotations.
    <br><br>
    In other words, imagine you're making a simple circular
    cookie... or... pizza. Then, you cut out a triangle in the middle with a knife, going almost
    to the edges. Then do that again, but first, rotate your triangle 10 degrees.
    If you're rotating by 10 degrees, to go all the way around you'll need to
    make (360 degrees / 10 degrees = 36 - 1) 35 triangle cutouts. What you'll be left
    with is a bunch of ridges on the inside.

  <h2>The Driver (Power Tool)</h2>
    It is not required to use a power tool. This bit can be used by hand as well.
    I prefer this bit by hand to any of the other hand drivers (I'm not biased).
