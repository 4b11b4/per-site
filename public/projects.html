      KiField <a href="https://github.com/xesscorp/KiField/commit/2e85f352304ecbc1efd44b24de2aed57eef965a0">(view commit)</a><br>
      Using `git submodules`
      to share schematic symbols, schematic blocks, and 
      PCB footprints between projects in KiCad allowed for 
      re-using (and encouraging standardization) schematics.<br>
      In addition to re-use, it is possible to travel back in time for the
      project, including the symbols, footprints, schematic blocks, etc. 
      This apparently involved more nested folders (than KiField knew about) 
      and so I spent some time fixing a bug in KiField to allow
      for the level of nesting I had created. When I probably could have been
      doing more important things.
      It felt awesome
      to <b>find</b> <i>and</i> fix this bug dough...
      <br>
      Besides nesting, I also introduced much friction for teammates using this
      method.
      Lessons learned creating friction. To make it easier, I could have made
      some very helpful shell scripts.
