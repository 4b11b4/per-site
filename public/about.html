  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>Growing up...</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Anton Sebastian Bilbaeno. My father named me after Anton Chekov,
    a Russian author of many types of writings. I was born in San Jose,
    California, but moved to Oregon at the age of four. I have lived here,
    with the exception of college, ever since.

    When we first moved to Oregon we lived in an apartment in Beaverton near
    where Highway 26 and 217 meet. At that time I was going to Ridgewood
    Elementary. We lived there for a few years then moved about 10 city blocks
    away to a house that we rented. We lived there for a few years then moved
    right next to where our apartment was, to a house that my mother bought.

    She was very frugal. I do not know how she did it, but she saved enough for
    the downpayment on that house, and enough for my brother and I to go to
    college witout ~5% loans from the government. Financial stability aside,
    my mother showed me discipline, is one of the biggest factors in me being
    "successful". And by "successful", I strictly will limit my definition to
    being educated enough to learn whatever I want.
