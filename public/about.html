  <h1>Growing Up...</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Anton Sebastian Bilbaeno.
  </p>
  <p>
    Born in San Jose, CA.<br>
    Moved to Beaverton, OR at the age of four, in 1994.<br>
    Live in Oregon since.
  </p>
  <p> 
    We moved to my grandmothers house.<br>
    The same house where my mother grew up.<br>
    I miss home with more than one generation.<br>
    <br>
    Shortly after, we moved to an apartment nearby.<br>
    Shortly after, we moved <b>a few blocks</b> to rent a house.<br>
    We lived in that house for a little while<br>
    then moved <b>back</b> towards the apartment<br>
    to a house that my mother bought.<br>
    <br>
    My mother lived there until she retired and sold it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beaverton is where I grew up, though I would not
    choose to live to live in the suburbs now.
    You have to drive everywhere, but there
    isn't
    anywhere to go. 
    The city is a little bit better. I can bike or ride the bus almost
    anywhere.
    Otherwise, I'd live in a more rural area or outside the US.
  </p>
  <p>
    My mother was very frugal. I do not know how, but she saved enough for the
    downpayment on that house and for both my brother and I to go to college
    without governent loans. All of those on sale items at the
    grocery store <b>do</b> add up...
  </p>
  <p>
    Stability aside, my mother showed me discipline and what it means to
    commit to something. Growing up, I starting playing soccer at a
    young age. I went on to play competitive soccer, sometimes known as "club"
    soccer in the US. I tried out for and was accepted to a very good team.
    A few years later, I didn't make the cut. I tried out for another team
    and they took me on. After being accepted to the new team, the old one 
    called me back. Of course I wanted to go back, but I had already made a
    commitment, and my mother told me that I must honor it. I'm
    sure I resented her at the time, but I wouldn't change that decision.
  </p>
    My mother is one of the biggest factors in me being "successful". 
    I will limit my definition of "success" strictly to the fact that: I
    am privileged to be able to see hope into the future for myself and 
    have enough time and energy to learn and apply myself to nearly anything. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I was named after a Russian
    author by my father. Anton Chekhov has a talent of being able to
    distill everyday interactions of
    human
    life into captivating stories that almost teach a lesson themselves.
    The stories, of course, never explicity "spell out" their true meaning
    and usually end
    abruptly, but the abrupt endings give you an opportunity to
    reflect immediately. 
    He is sometimes known as
    of the greatest writers of short fiction stories.
    Some of Chekhov's
    writings may seem mundane or inconclusive, but they are for you
    to make your own interpretation, as is all art.
