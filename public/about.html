  <h2>Growing up...</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Anton Sebastian Bilbaeno. My father named me after a Russian
    author who is excellent at portraying basic aspects of human
    life in such a vivid and captivating manner. He is famously known as one
    of the greatest writers of short fiction stories. Some of Chekhov's
    writings may seem mundane or inconclusive, but they are for you
    to make your own interpretation, as is true of all art.
  </p>
    This Anton was born in San Jose, California but moved to Beaverton,
    Oregon at the young age of four, in 1994. I have lived in Oregon ever
    since.

    When we came to Oregon we lived with my grandmother in the
    house where my mother grew up. Shortly after, we moved to an
    apartment near the intersection of Highway 26 and 217.
    We lived in that apartment for a few years and then moved a few
    blocks away to a house that we rented. We lived in that house for a few
    years and then moved back towards the apartment to a house that my mother
    bought. We lived there for more than a few years. My mother recently
    retired and sold it. Beaverton is where I grew up, although I would never
    choose to live there now. The city is better because I can bike and walk
    almost anywhere, although I'd truly rather live way out of town on a farm.

    She was very frugal. I do not know how, but she saved enough for the
    downpayment on that house and for both my brother and I to go to college
    without loans from the government. All of those on sale items at the
    grocery store <b>do</b> add up.
  </p>

    Stability aside, my mother showed me discipline and what it means to
    commit to something. Growing up, I starting playing soccer at a
    young age. I went on to play competitive soccer, sometimes known as "club"
    soccer in the US. I tried out for and was accepted to a very good team.
    A few years later, I didn't make the cut. I tried out for another team
    and they took me on. After being accepted to the new team, the old one 
    called me back. Of course I wanted to go back, but I had already made a
    commitment, and my mother told me that I must honor it. I'm
    sure I resented her at the time, but I wouldn't change that decision. And,
    according to my father, when our teams played each other, I made my old
    coach regret it. He confessed to my father during the game:
    "I think I made the wrong decision..."
  </p>
    My mother is one of the biggest factors in me being "successful". 
    I will limit my definition of "success" strictly to the fact that I
    am privileged to be able to see hope into the future for myself and 
    have the time and power to learn and apply myself to nearly anything.
