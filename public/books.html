      <b>Meditations - Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (A.D. 120 - 180)</b><br>
      <i>Gregory Hays' Translation (2002)</i><br>
      <p>
      Marcus Aurelius succeeded his adoptive father to become the emperor 
      of Rome in A.D. 161.<br>
      Shortly after being adopted, the emperor of Rome died, and Marcus was
      first in line for the throne. He grew up "upper class", and his
      education was of great importance. At the time, "upper class" Romans
      were essentially bilingual in Greek and Latin.<br>
      Many great thinkers of the time were Greek, and thus 
      discussion of philosophy at the time would required knowledge of the
      language.

      <b>The Philosphy of Teaching by Arnold Tompkins (1893)</b><br>
      <p>It is interesting that this book was published so long ago, yet schools
      around the world (I only know the US) remain in the state of producing
      workers for factories. Maybe this is not so interesting, because it is
      obvious, but it remains that this book was published over 100 year ago.
      <br><br>
      This book discusses the processes by which a mind
      comes to know something and the teacher's duty of providing the student
      with the means to reach a point of knowledge on their own -- in contrast
      to simply regurgitating knowledge. The book also discusses what it means
      to be a teacher -- a position of the highest moral obligation.</p>
