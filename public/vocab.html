    <li><b>word</b>, (date found, found in, author): definition</li>
    <li><b>Archimedean point</b>, (8/26/19, An Essay On Man, Ernst Cassirer):<br>
      It is said that Archimedes claimed he could move the Earth if he were
      standing at a point far enough away and given an equally long lever arm.<br>
      The Punctum Archimedis is also known as a theoretical point where you
      are able to perceive something objectively and totally. 
      It is the ideal to 
      remove yourself from the object of study in order to see it unbiased
      and clearly, with no relation to yourself. Of course, many would say
      this is impossible, as man cannot separate from himself.
